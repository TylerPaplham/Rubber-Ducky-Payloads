# Rubber-Ducky-Payloads

This repository contains payloads that can be used on a Raspberry Pi Pico using Circuit Python. These payloads can also be used for Hak5 Rubber Ducky's but you'll need to encode the payload instead.

For help installing Circuit Python see: https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky

For the official Hak5 Rubber Ducky Payloads see: https://github.com/hak5/usbrubberducky-payloads

To encode a ducky script see: https://ducktoolkit.com/
